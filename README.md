A super-basic block plugin for OJS 2.4, it display static sharing buttons on article pages.

Based on the standard authorBios block and the [Simple Sharing Button Generator](https://simplesharingbuttons.com/) (by [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish/)), it uses icons from [Flat Web Icon Set](http://iconsandcoffee.com/freebie-flat-web-icon-set/) (by [Icons&Coffee](http://iconsandcoffee.com/))

Currently it includes only:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google+
- Pocket
- LinkedIn
- Reddit

No external dependencies, no cookies, no js, no options.
